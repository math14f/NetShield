# Privacy Policy for NetShield

**Last Updated:** 12. Oktober 2025

NetShield ("the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension is designed to be a secure, local-first web filtering tool.

## Data Collection

NetShield **does not collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal data or user activity.**

Specifically:
- We do not track your browsing history.
- We do not log which sites are blocked or allowed.
- We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email, or IP address.

All filtering logic is performed locally within your browser. The extension does not communicate with any external servers, except to fetch remote blocklists and allowlists from URLs defined by you or your administrator. This communication does not include any of your personal data.

## How We Use Permissions

- **declarativeNetRequest:** Used to apply blocking rules without ever seeing your web traffic.
- **storage:** Used to save administrator-defined settings.
- **alarms:** Used to periodically refresh the blocking rules.
- **host_permissions:** Required for the filtering rules to apply to all websites.
